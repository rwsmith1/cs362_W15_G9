Prepared for CS 419 at Oregon State University

__Executive Summary.__ Our system consists of 3 components: a Python program that may be implemented in a Procmail filter that parses incoming advising system email messages and sends out email messages with iCalendar objects attached that reflect the content of the advising emails; an `ncurses` front-end that allows an advisor to view his or her upcoming appointments from a Unix-type operating system terminal and cancel them if necessary; and a database back-end that both components interact with to store and retrieve appointment data. It is designed to integrate into the existing student advising scheduling system as specified by our clientâ€™s initial requirements documentation.

Please consult the complete documentation (CS419_W15_G9_Final_Report.pdf) for additional information.
